# What's this?
Tesseract Chain will be simplified Bitcoin based test chain. This is project for learning, researching and development blockchain and other techonologies that i have studied and will study in future. 

After MVP on btc techs i will try to rebuild it on Ethereum techs.

# How it should looks?
It will be a site with authorize mechanism where you can sign up and send some transactions at an early stage and... 
some other stuff that i will come up with later ;)
